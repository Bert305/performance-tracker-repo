//- To view the page in the browser, you need to follow these steps:

//- 1. Make sure you have a web server installed on your local machine. If you don't have one, you can install a lightweight server like `http-server` or `live-server` using npm.

//- 2. Open your command line or terminal and navigate to the directory where your `sample.pug` file is located. In your case, it would be `/c:/Users/Owner/OneDrive/Desktop/Task-Performance-Tracker/mern-backend-rest-api-s-2022/server/`.

//- 3. Start the web server by running the appropriate command. For example, if you are using `http-server`, you can run `http-server` command in the terminal.

//- 4. Once the server is running, it will display a URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`). Copy this URL and open it in your web browser.

//- 5. The browser will now load the `sample.pug` file, and you should be able to see the rendered HTML output.

//- Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed and configured correctly for your server to work properly.
